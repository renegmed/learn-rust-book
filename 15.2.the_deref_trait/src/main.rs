        The reason the deref method returns a reference to a value and

        is still necessary is due to the ownership system. 
        
        If the deref method returned the value directly instead of a reference 
        to the value, the value would be moved out of self. We donâ€™t want to 
        take ownership of the inner value inside MyBox<T> in this case and 
        in most cases where we use the dereference operator.
